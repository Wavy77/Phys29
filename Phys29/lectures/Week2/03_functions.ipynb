The line of code defining the function must end with a colon `:`. The `return` command indicates what the function outputs or returns to the calling program. Note that this line is *indented*. The purpose of this indentation is to delineate the lines of code that are within the function and separate these lines from the code that precedes or follows it. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be at least one space and it must be the same for all subsequent lines within the function (unless you introduce another block of code within the function - more on that in a bit).  The Jupyter notebook editor automatically indents by four spaces after a `def` statement in a Code cell if you type the tab key, and I highly recommend that you stick with this convention.  The best way to format the indentations in python is by using the tab key which gives you four space indentations. "
