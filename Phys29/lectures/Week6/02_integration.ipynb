    "## Numerical Integration Using Scipy\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion above has illustrated some of the basic principles underlying numerical integration. Namely, one can approximate the area under a curve by summing over the function values at a set of abscissas, weighted by a set of weights.  Clever choices of absicissas and weights can result in error cancellations that lead to more accurate approximations. This results in a better scaling of the error with the number of function evaluations (strips in our examples) $n$, producing more bang for computational buck.  The actual error depends on the specific behavior of the function over the entire interval, which can be smaller than the theoretical upper bounds we presented above. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we don't need to implement these methods ourselves, as they are already implemented in the `scipy` library in a module `integrate` that contains a function `quad` that can be used to perform numerical integration.  The `quad` function performs [**Clenched-Curtis quadrature**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clenshaw–Curtis_quadrature) as the default, which is a general purpose quadrature technique  that is is more efficient and accurate than the methods we discussed above. \n",
