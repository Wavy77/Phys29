    "The Jupyter *notebook* is a relatively new feature that has been implemented with Python, and allows you to write notebooks similar to e.g. Mathematica. As we discussed, it runs within your Web-Browser either locally via e.g. jupyter lab and your local python installation, or in a IDE like VSCode, or remotely via Google Colab. The advantage of using notebooks is that you can include text, code, and plots in the same document. This makes it ideal for example to write up a report about a project that uses mostly Python code, in order to share with others. In fact, the notes for this course are written using Jupyter notebooks!"
