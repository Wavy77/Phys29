    "Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. It offers an organized method for multiple developers to collaborate on projects by keeping a record of modifications, additions, and deletions to files over time. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider a real world example that Prof. Hennawi has used in my own research. He has worked on developing an automated Python based software package called [PypeIt](https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt \"PypeIt\"), that can be used to reduce and analyze astronomical data. PypeIt is an open source project that is developed by a team of around 10 astronomers and software developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the PypeIt codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” stable version of source code that is used by hundreds of astronomers. Since, if they were to introduce a mistake or \"bug\" into the code, they would break the code used by hundreds of astronomers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, version control enables a developer or team of developers to safely modify code via operations called branching and merging. This allows for the an easy and controlled way of developing complex software, and a nice way to allow for multiple people to collaborate on this type of projects. Additionally, and as its name suggests, version control allows you to revert back to a previous iteration of the code. There are plenty of resources on the internet where you can easily learn more about this. But, for now, how do you actually do version control? That is where git (and GitHub) comes in."

Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough such that even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line. Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects. Once again, the course's materials will be hosted in a GitHub repository. This means that you could also access them by using all the available tools, typically through the terminal.
